# Coding-Challenges-Guide

Do you have a coding interview ahead of you or want to fine-tune your technical interview skills?

I wanted to share my experience in doing coding challenges. For the past 6 years, I have been applying to various companies from local startups to big companies like Amazon, I didn’t always get the job there but at some point, I started to gather the data and create the checklist that helps me these days when I’m applying for a job.

Hope it will be useful to you too!
