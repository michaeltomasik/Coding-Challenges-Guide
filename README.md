# Coding-Challenges-Guide

Do you have a coding interview ahead of you or want to fine-tune your technical interview skills?

I wanted to share my experience in doing coding challenges. For the past 6 years, I have been applying to various companies from local startups to big companies like Amazon, I didn’t always get the job there but at some point, I started to gather the data and create the checklist that helps me these days when I’m applying for a job.

Hope it will be useful to you too!

### 2.  Types of Coding Challenges:

<b>Time puzzle tasks</b> - The most “lazy” way of testing your coding knowledge by using websites such as HackerRank, LeetCode. The recruiter sends you a pre-prepared coding assignment in which you have a fixed amount of time to solve ex. 2h. Tasks are really general checking your overall knowledge but the clock that is ticking creates uncomfortable pressure. In the end, you send your solution which is checked by multiple test cases if you pass that then the developer is checking it. What it tells me about the company is that they didn’t really invest much time into a coding challenge.








<b>Algorithm driven tasks</b> - Those are the most common in big corporations like Google, Amazon, Facebook, or Apple. They might seem hard at the beginning but it is just a matter of practice. There are plenty of good websites where they explain the most common algorithms and ways of calculating algorithm complexity (BigO).


<b>Make a simple app (most common)</b> - The company created a custom task that will check your skillset. It is usually coding a simple app that resembles their product. What I like about those tasks is that even if you fail you might get feedback on what was wrong and improve your coding skills. Plus, you are building your portfolio and in the future, you might just send the code sample to the company and avoid the stress of the recruitment process. It might also include live coding parts like explaining the code and solution you used to the recruiter or making code adjustments.


<b>Live coding</b> - Most interesting way of checking one’s skills. It is always stressful to write your code on the whiteboard or showing it via screen sharing. It can be any type of task, from writing some simple basic logic to complicated algorithms. It aims to understand better your thought process. The most important part is to be vocal about every step you take, so a recruiting person knows how you solve the problem.

Great! Now we have an understanding of what can we expect from the companies.
Let’s dig a bit deeper and divided companies into 3 categories.


### 3.  Companies types:



<b>The one to avoid</b> - Usually their process is really short. They are looking for any developer that is willing to work with their legacy codebase and maintain it, never heard about testing.







<b>The “normal” company</b> - The codebase is modern, you are feeling some sort of progress, the app has some basic tests, it becomes really quickly comfortable to work with.






<b>The dream job company</b> - The companies I usually know before joining them, or I have been using their product myself. They have high coding standard, heavily tested, people working for there are usually more self-driven and more ambitious. Every day feels like you are learning new things and growing.

### 5.	How to prepare for each coding challenge?

<b>Time puzzle tasks</b> - Code Wars, LeetCode, Hackerrank

<b>Algorithm driven tasks</b> - CS DOJO, Book “cracking coding interview” by Gayle Laakmann McDowell

<b>Make a simple app</b> - It really depends on your skillset and language you choose. I’m providing a checklist that will minimalize your chances of getting rejected. 



<b>Checklist:</b>
- [ ] Make sure you have separated the logic
- [ ] Make sure you always write essential tests
- [ ] Install Eslint to keep your code nice and clean
- [ ] Don’t over-engineer your code, Keep it simple 
- [ ] Test your app with a slow connection
- [ ] Test your app with lost connection (Offline mode)
- [ ] Don’t load the whole lodash, import only functions you are using
- [ ] Ask your somebody to review your coding solution (Feel free to contact me if you need help with this one)
- [ ] After writing the solution give yourself 1-2 days to check it again and catch things that you missed



<b>Live coding</b> - For this part try to practice everything above, if you are interested in how to solve those coding challenges visit my videos where I’m solving a few interview tasks Programming Struggles
